Description: # map_matching
        
        `map_matching` is a Python library that associates a sequence of
        locations (e.g. GPS trajectory) to the underlying road network. The
        matching considers both road network topology and spatial
        relations. The library provides a simple interface for use, and above
        that it is also intended to work nicely with PostGIS and OSM road
        network to build real-world applications.
        
        
        ## Features
        
        - Provide both offline and online matching
        - Support PostGIS with OSM road network loaded
        - Designed to be fast, even in Python
        
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        See [Getting Started](https://github.com/mapillary/map_matching) for
        more information.
        
        
        ## Tests
        
        We use [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to run unit
        tests.
        
        Currently we put code and tests together for the sake of
        convenience. To test a single module, for example, `shortest_path.py`,
        simply:
        
        ```bash
        $ nosetest map_matching/shortest_path.py
        ```
        
        To run all unit tests:
        
        ```bash
        $ nosetest map_matching/*.py
        ```
